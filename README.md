# Direct-Mail-Fundraising 

Our objective is to use the dataset collected by the United States National Veteransâ€™ Organization to develop a predictive model that can effectively capture donors so that expected net profit is maximized. Ideally, our predictive model will be able to tell us the attributes of the expected donors, so we could plan where to send the direct-mail fundraisers in order to target those expected donors.
